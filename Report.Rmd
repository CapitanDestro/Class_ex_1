##Research Question
Are National Parliaments representative of the population in relation to the age?

##Hypothesis
We wanted to see whether National parliaments were in line with the population distribution in terms of age.
Our hypothesis was that, even with low variability, to a younger population would have corresponded a younger parliament.

##Dataset
We took our data from the "Global Parliamentary Report".
We got .xls file containing data about several national parliaments in the world; the data included sex, age and profession of each PM.
